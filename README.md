Hi, I’m Daniel, a Software Engineer with experience in JavaScript, React.js, Redux, Node.js, Express.js, Knex.js, and SQL. I am at my best when I can take on challenges with a hands-on approach, and I enjoy working in a collaborative and fast-paced team environment.

I'm currently a Frontend Engineer for the Underdog Devs project - doing developing and debugging
Previously, I spent the last 3+ years in IT services and motivated technical teams with solution recommendations and process improvement designs for dental office hardware/software projects.
